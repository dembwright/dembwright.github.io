            <h1>Podcasts</h1>
            <p>Some of the podcasts I listen to frequently.</p>

<h2 id="hard-fork"><a href="./Hard-Fork/">Hard Fork</a></h2>
<p>I like this podcast to stay up to date with recent tech news. I find Casey and Kevin to be entertaining as well as informative. They have decent conenctions in the tech world and are very pro-journalism.</p>
<h2 id="the-ezra-klein-show"><a href="./The-Ezra-Klein-Show/">The Ezra Klein Show</a></h2>
<p>I like this podcast to hear interesting perspectives on geopolitics, and recent topics. I think Ezraâ€™s questions for his well-educated guests make him standout as an interviewer.</p>
<h2 id="intelligence-squared"><a href="./Intelligence-Squared">Intelligence Squared</a></h2>
<p>I like this podcast to learn about a variety of topics like history, geopolitics, politics, and hear people debate.</p>
<h2 id="lex-fridman-podcast"><a href="./Lex-Fridman-Podcast">Lex Fridman Podcast</a></h2>
<p>I like this podcast to make influential people more human. Lex lets opposing viewpoints get the podium. These episodes are several hours long which I like because we can get a below-surface-level understanding of people and their views. However recently, I think it is becoming less thoughtful and more like a Joe Rogan.</p>
<h2 id="left-right--center"><a href="./Left-Right-Center">Left, Right &amp; Center</a></h2>
<p>I like this podcast to understand the perspective of different lawyers and their take on current legal policies and politics.</p>
<h2 id="imf-podcasts"><a href="./IMF-Podcasts">IMF Podcasts</a></h2>
<p>I like this podcast to hear global economists talk about their research and strategies.</p>
<h2 id="extras"><a href="./Extras">Extras</a></h2>
<p>These are some episodes produced by people whom I do not listen to consistently.</p>
